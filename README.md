# Deep Learning for Brain MRI Classification 🧠🔬

## 📌 Introduction
This project explores **Deep Learning models** for **Brain MRI Tumor Classification**. The dataset used is the **Brain Tumor MRI Scans** from Kaggle, and multiple neural network architectures (CNN, EfficientNet, ResNet, and VGG16) are implemented to classify images into tumor and non-tumor categories.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Handling**:
  - Downloading and preprocessing MRI scans from Kaggle.
  - Using `image_dataset_from_directory` for efficient data loading.
- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - Custom **CNN architectures** for image classification.
  - Pre-trained models including **EfficientNet, ResNet, and VGG16** for transfer learning.
- **Training and Optimization**:
  - Applying **EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, and ModelCheckpoint**.
  - Using **TensorBoard** for real-time training monitoring.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Generating **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report**.
  - Performance analysis using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
